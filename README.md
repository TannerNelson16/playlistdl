# Audio Downloader

A self-hosted web application for downloading songs, albums, or playlists from Spotify and YouTube as MP3 files. The application provides a web interface for users to input links, which are then downloaded as audio files using `spotdl` (for Spotify) or `yt-dlp` (for YouTube).

## Features

- **Download Spotify and YouTube playlists**: Automatically detects and processes playlists based on the URL.
- **Session-based download directories**: Isolates each user session to a unique download directory.
- **Admin Mode**: Enables admin users to download directly to a specified folder on the server.
- **Progress bar and download logs**: View download progress and logs in real-time via the web interface.
- **Auto-cleanup**: Deletes temporary session download folders after a specified time.
- **Organized Downloads**: Downloads are structured by artist and album folders, maintaining organization across downloads.
<!--- **Admin mode**: Allows the admin to specify a custom directory for downloads.
